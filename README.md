# `yt_no_contents`

+ chrome extension that removes the video contents that appear, mostly trying
  to target recommended videos

+ should remove video links from youtube unless you search for them

+ weird behavior when searching sometimes the request for the search appears
  on `update` event to be coming from `youtube.com` without the `search_query`
  inside the url so it fails (just reload the page or off-on the extension)

# incentive

+ too much time doom scrolling through youtube

# note

+ I am by no means an extension developer

+ I am by no means saying this is something that anyone should use as a model
  or anything by any means; just some snippets of code combined together to
  stop you from scrolling youtube mindlessly.
